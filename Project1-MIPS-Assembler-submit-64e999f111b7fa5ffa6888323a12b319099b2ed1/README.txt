This is README file for Project1-MIPS-Assembler.

We are TEAM #46 20150326 Park Si Hwan and 20150824 Hwang Jae Young.

The main file is 'mips_assembler.cpp'.

Please use 'make' command to generate runfile.

And then, run runfile with target assembly file.

Like this, ./runfile <assembly file>

(ex) ./runfile ./Project1_examples/example1.s

Finally, the result of MIPS assembler will be printed in terminal(stdout).
